# book-data-analysis-blog
This project is from the Applied Machine Learning course at UBC and was completed with a partner. A dataset that we chose from Kaggle was analyzed using the machine learning techniques we learned with Python's scikit-learn library. In addition to handling categorical versus numerical data, we had to use count_vectorizer to deal with the raw text data in this dataset. All the findings were compiled and presented in the form a blog post. The goal of this blog post is show how we can take the findings of an analysis like this and present it clearly to an audience that is not familiar with machine learning (in this case the target audience was university students with a technical background but no knowledge of machine learning).
